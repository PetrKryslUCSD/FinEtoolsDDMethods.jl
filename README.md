# FinEtoolsDDMethods.jl

Domain decomposition methods: solvers and algorithms used with FinEtools applications. 

## News

- 08/29/2024: Cleanup of the interface. Sequential, MPI, threaded execution supported.

## Capabilities and limitations

Only linear static problems are addressed at the moment. `FinEtools` discretization only.

- Schur-based decomposition for conjugate gradient iteration. 
- Overlapping Schwarz two-level preconditioning of conjugate gradient iteration with coherent node clusters.

Both of the above can now be expressed as MPI-parallel algorithms.

## Examples

Please refer to the `README` in the `examples` folder for instructions 
on how to get the examples to run.
